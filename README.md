## Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using linear regression to estimate the prices of houses based on various features and attributes. This model aims to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions by providing accurate price predictions. It clearly depicts the trend using visualization.

## Key Activities:

**Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing information about houses, including features such as size, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, age, and other relevant attributes. Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

**Feature Selection and Engineering**: Identify the most significant features that influence house prices and create new features if necessary. This step involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (house price).

**Model Development**: Implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on the selected features. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

**Model Evaluation and Validation**: Assess the accuracy and performance of the linear regression model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Validate the model by comparing its predictions with actual house prices on the test dataset.

**Optimization and Tuning**: Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters, adding or removing features, and experimenting with different regularization techniques to improve its predictive accuracy.

## Technologies Used:

**Programming Languages:**\
_Python_: The primary language for data analysis, model development, and implementation due to its extensive libraries and ease of use.

**Data Handling and Analysis:**\
_Pandas_: For data manipulation and analysis, including data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.\
_NumPy_: For numerical computations and handling arrays.

**Data Visualization:**\
_Matplotlib_: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.\
_Seaborn_: For statistical data visualization, making it easier to plot complex graphs.

**Machine Learning Libraries:**\
_Scikit-learn_: For implementing linear regression models, feature selection, model evaluation, and validation.

**Data Preprocessing:**\
_Scikit-learn Preprocessing_: For scaling, encoding categorical variables, and handling missing values.

**Model Evaluation:**\
_Scikit-learn Metrics_: For calculating evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**\
_Colab Notebook_: For interactive development, data exploration, and visualization.
